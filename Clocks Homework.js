/*
Task: "Clock"
You need to implement an electronic clock with a calendar that displays the current time and date.

1. Use the template from the link for the visual design of the clock. The template can be found here.
2. Create a script file on your own and connect it to the HTML page. All the logic for the application should reside in this file.
3. To implement the clock, use the functionality of the built-in Date object and setInterval functions.
4. Upon loading the application, use new Date() to get the current time and date and display it on the screen.
5. Use the setInterval function to run a special function every second (or more frequently) that will redraw the current time if necessary.
6. Thus, the information displayed on the screen should be: "Today is Wednesday, January 10. Current time: 14:25:45"
7. You also need to display information about how many days are left until the next year. Format: "There are 327 days left until 2019."
